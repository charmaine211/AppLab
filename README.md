# Veilig Thuis Application

[Veilig Thuis](https://veiligthuis.nl/) is an important platform that provides advice, support, and the ability to report domestic violence and child abuse. The veilig Thuis app brings this functionality to Android devices, making it easier to make reports and provide caregivers access to relevant records.

## Features

The Veilig Thuis app offers various features to assist users in reporting situations and accessing important information:

- **Reports**: Users can submit reports of domestic violence and child abuse through the app. This includes providing detailed information and relevant attachments to make the situation as clear as possible for caregivers. These reports can be accessed by caregivers so they can take the necessary action.

- **Tips**: Caregivers can provide valuable tips and advice to users through the app. These tips can cover dealing with specific situations, finding resources, and taking preventive measures.

## Test User for Caregivers

For testing the caregiver view in the app, use the following login credentials:

- **Username**: test@test.com
- **Password**: password123

## Design

The design of the application is based on the Veilig Thuis website: [veiligthuis.nl](https://veiligthuis.nl). We have ensured that the design is suitable for a mobile app and have created a prototype that can be viewed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/BQEdSfJhznQVubYN4C01pl/Veilig-Thuis?node-id=50-2&starting-point-node-id=50%3A2&mode=design&t=n1ftaUztJNGYUHSz-1). This provides an overview of the different screens and navigation flows in the app.
